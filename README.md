Yet Another space shooter

Baddies invade your space around X-AREA-51, shoot them down or perish. - lol, k.
Support for high score, local and remote
Endless Game mode
(Campaign Game mode)

*PROS:*
-- Not just a 'Space Invaders' shooter
-- Uses the device's accelerometer to navigate around the game scene
-- Shoots on its own -> less tapping, less strain in the fingers

*CONS:*
-- You've already played this...
-- Like a hundred times
-- Lacks the functionality of a full-featured space shooter
-- But then again it was developer longer
